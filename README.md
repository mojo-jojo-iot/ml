# Machine Learning Scripts

Welcome to the repository! This is where I upload simple scripts and projects I’m working on as I learn data science, machine learning, and AI concepts. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Data Science Basics**: Exploration, cleaning, and visualization of datasets.
- **Machine Learning**: Simple implementations of algorithms like regression, classification, clustering, etc.
- **Deep Learning**: Basic neural networks and experiments using TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- **AI Concepts**: Fun AI algorithms and experiments to explore the field.
